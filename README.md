# Howdy ü§†

This repository contains all the solutions I managed to complete or attempt at
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). If you want to check this year
undergoing event solutions you can check them [here](./2023).

Every problem on this repository also contains a readme file that takes you
to the problem page in the AOC website. Also, I tried to solve most of them
with both C and C++. But some of them might be available only in C++ as I'm
better at it. (More languages might come in the future if I feel like it)

This is by no means an attempt to teach algorithms, its just a place to store
everything I've managed to solve for further reference and to display.
That beign said, feel free to look through the problems and even point out
better solutions if you want, I'm 100% open to DMs on any platform.

You can find me mostly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/4wiru) and
[Discord](https://discord.com/users/434825571785244672), I'm very friendly
I promise üßê

If you're looking for other kinds of algoritms coding problems I also have a
repository filled with (mostly) LeetCode problems, you chan check at
[wllfaria/leet-the-code](https://github.com/wllfaria/leet-the-code).
